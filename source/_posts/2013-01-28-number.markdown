There’s an old saying that goes, “The only numbers developers care about are 0, 1, and N.”
Sounds like the punch line to a bad joke, right? But what it means is that developers have 
to make sure their code accounts for those numbers.

Once I heard this saying, and the reason for it, I tried to remember those numbers when I was designing. For example:

* <bold>0.</bold> How does my design handle 0 of something? What does it look like if there are no items in my container, whether it’s an email folder, a to-do list, a list of chats? Is there anything special my app or site needs to do to indicate or handle this 0 of something? How am I going to do it?

* <bold>1.</bold> What does 1 of something look like? Are there any special cases related to having only 1 of something?

* <bold>N.</bold> N isn’t always so easy. It could be anything from 3 to 300, or even 3,000. How will my design accommodate N of something?
As it turns out, there are other special numbers when it comes to UX design. One of them is the number 2, as I recently noticed while using Twitter for iPhone.

I have two Twitter accounts, and sometimes I switch between them to tweet different types of things.

Here’s what my main account’s profile looks like. If I tap the “Accounts” button, I get a list of my accounts.

doesn’t toggle between two accounts" />

To switch, I tap the button, pick my other account, and wait for the window to close.

But wait. I only have *two* accounts. Why, when I tap this button, should I have to see a list of accounts and manually select my other account? When I have two accounts configured, Twitter should just swap them. That button should just *toggle* between my two accounts. The number 2 is a special case.

So, some numbers to keep in mind while you’re designing: 0, 1, 2, and N. And there could be others, depending on the domain and tasks you’re trying to accommodate. You might want to add them to a design checklist to make sure you haven’t missed them before your next design review.
