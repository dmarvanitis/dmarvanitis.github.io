A while back, I watched a webinar by UIE titled <a href="https://www.uie.com/events/virtual_seminars/hiring_designers/">“Hiring the Best UX Designers”</a>. It contained some great tips, including dumping high-pressure, day-of design exercises in favor of week-long assignments, which we can all agree more closely resembles an actual work scenario. The idea has stuck with me but I haven't had a chance yet to put it into practice.

Yesterday, I saw a <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3026463/from-google-ventures-5-rules-for-writing-great-interface-copy">FastCoDesign article by Google Ventures‘ John Zeratsky </a> that said, “…my visually unsophisticated (it’s okay, you can say “ugly”) prototypes often perform well in user research—regularly beating out beautiful, polished, sexy prototypes.”

These two references got me thinking that the best way to evaluate an interaction designer‘s skill might not even be a design review of the week-long assignment. It might be an *actual usability test*.

Something that’s been bothering me a lot lately is the current focus on visual design at the expense of interaction design and usability. Today’s app landscape is flooded with products that are visually attractive but which (a) fail to solve users’ problems or (b) do so in a way that is cumbersome, error-prone, and inelegant. As many of us know firsthand, it’s all too easy to sit through a presentation of someone’s strikingly beautiful portfolio—even if it includes sufficient information about the person’s role and design process—and still have no strong idea how well he or she will do when asked to solve design problems on a daily basis.

# How well do you design in black and white?

I can imagine preparing a design assignment that includes the production of a basic interactive prototype that supports certain tasks. On the day of the interview, the designer would present his or her design solution to the team. Next, we would have a member of support staff (e.g., someone from Accounting) attempt to perform those tasks using the prototype.

This would accomplish a few things:

* prevent the design team from focusing primarily on the applicant’s visual-design skills
* provide facts that reduce disagreement about the designer’s skill level

# Caveats

Things to keep in mind in attempting this technique include:

* a different support-staff person should participate in each test to prevent learning effects
* some designers might still argue that the participant is “just one person” and that his or her data should be discounted

Still, the next time I need to hire a designer, this is exactly what I’m going to try. We can refine the method as we go, but based on past experience I imagine it would provide important insights into a designer’s skills and values.

Would love to hear your thoughts via Twitter.
